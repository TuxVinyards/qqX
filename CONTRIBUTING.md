# Ideas and Creativity are most important

- Try to follow the Coding Style and Guidance outlined at the end of the qqX main script

- But don't worry if you only know POSIX Shell and Coding Style is getting in the way

- Things can always get sorted out in a separate branch if need be, later

## Do explain what's going and why

- If no one can follow or understand what you have done, it won't get added

## Try to split your work up

- Larger contributions _should_ always be written in several commits

## Test your work

- Ideally, it should have been linted with ShellCheck

- Complex code should ideally be tested with different distro's and different desktops and managers

## Screenshots can help

- Sometimes a picture can tell a thousand words ...
