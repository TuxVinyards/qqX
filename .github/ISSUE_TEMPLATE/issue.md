### Screenshots & Error messages

### Description of tests conducted and results

Standard  elimination and substitution methods should be used prior to posting:

- Does it happen to all VM's & does it happen when you try directly with quickemu itself?  

Have you tried different Virtual Machines?

- If it only happens to one VM then re-install the machine or try creating another version.

Did the problems start when somthing was updated?

- Both older and newer versions of Quickemu are available as qqX builtins

- Make sure that you have checked the [qqX branches](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX/branches). Fixes may already have been committed.

When checking the issues list make sure the filter is not just `is:issue is:open`

Also try the closed tab `is:issue is:closed`
