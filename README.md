## Install

Start the set up with original quickemu as normal.  <https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu>

Download the latest qqX release [here](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX/releases/latest) and run the installer.

qqX will auto-detect if new releases are available & quietly prompt for updates

## Beta notes

The scripts are now stable and polished \@ beta 12.  Testing the updater has to be done on a live public release basis, so early adopters/testers should check back every few days until this is cleared.  The installer has been tested on a variety of mainstream distros. Feedback, positive or constructive, at <https://discord.gg/sNmz3uw> please ...
