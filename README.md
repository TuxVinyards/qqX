## Install

Start the set up with original quickemu as normal.  <https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu>

Download the latest qqX release [here](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX/releases/latest) and run the installer.

qqX will auto-detect if new releases are available & quietly prompt for updates.

Use the installer to update, reinstall, uninstall or reconfigure.

## Beta notes

The scripts are stable and the installer has been tested on a variety of mainstream distros.

They have been written with plenty of preventative error handling routines. However, as with all software, please remember that standard good practice is to always make backups of anything critical.
