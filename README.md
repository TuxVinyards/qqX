## Install

Start the set up with original quickemu as normal.  <https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu>

Download the latest qqX release [here](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX/releases/latest) and run the installer.

`sha256sum -c qqX-x.xx.xx.xx.tar.gz.sha.256`  to check the file.

qqX will auto-detect if new releases are available & quietly prompt for updates.

Use the installer to update, reinstall, uninstall or reconfigure.

## Beta notes

The next stage on from quickemu-mod ... Now available

These late beta scripts have been consistently safe & stable. Testing has been carried out on a variety of mainstream distros.  

Current focus is now on streamlining.  An automated settings file updater is in the works.

The scripts have been written with plenty of preventative error handling routines. 

Feel confident but do remember standard good practice:  with ALL software make backups of anything critical.
