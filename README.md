## Install

Start the set up with original quickemu as normal.  <https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu>

Download the latest qqX release [here](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX/releases/latest) and run the installer.

May be installed alongside any pre-existing quickemu interfacing, such as quickgui or quickemu shortcuts.

`sha256sum -c qqX-x.xx.xx.xx.tar.gz.sha.256`  to check the file.

qqX will auto-detect if new releases are later available & quietly prompt for updates.

Use the installer to update, reinstall, uninstall or reconfigure.

## Beta notes

*Standard good practice* with any software is to backup anything critical ...

Testing has been carried out on a variety of mainstream distros. Only a few small streamlining tasks remain.

These late beta scripts have been consistently safe & stable.  The release candidate should be available shortly.

All scripts have been carefully Shellcheck linted & have additional backup and error handling routines.
