#  THIS SCRIPT SHOULD BE RUN FROM INSIDE THE qqX DOWNLOAD/SOURCE FOLDER, where it will expect to find the right files 
#  OR  run the target script "./qqX_system_install"  from qqX.system folder directly

#  From version 1.10.03  a posix friendly .sh script is used as a wrapper, to make sure that it double click executes properly
#  in Qt / KDE XFCE etc desktop environments.  

#   IF: your file manager allows > double mouse click & 'run in terminal' or 'execute'

#   OR:  in the script's folder > right click > 'run as program' or 'run in konsole' or 'run in terminal'

#   OR:  in the script's folder > right click > open in terminal >  type "./qqX_setup_and_install"   (note prefix ./)

#   FOR ANY NEWER OR NON-STANDARD TERMINAL, SETTING UP A CUSTOM TERMINAL PROFILE IS RECOMMENDED
#   as this will cause the values to be stored for future updates.

#   CUSTOM terminal sizes & profile should be set just after the initial system checking lines
#   in the target script "./qqX_system_install" in the qqX.system folder. See notes in the target script.

#   shellcheck disable=SC2009,SC2034

#   Terminal name may also be set here, for one-time usage, if '-e' exec functions are recognised:

# NB 'Type' is a Bash builtin, type -p is not supported in 'dash' so command -v needed. 

## Selection of terminal:

# Priority is given to main stream user bases and those offering geometry parameters
# 85% of users are probably covered by the first four: "gnome-terminal" "konsole" "mate-terminal" "xfce4-terminal" 
# Over 95% probably when "qterminal" and "alacritty" are added.

# There are several popular post-install terminals with various special feature sets. 
# However, it is very unlikely to find these and these alone. An underlying standard desktop environment terminal 
# can generally be expected to be available so exhaustive checks are not needed.

# Kitty is relatively stable and has more or less standard behaviour, so it has been added for good measure.

# On the other hand, many of these leading edge, often cross-platform terminals are still in active development 
# and are liable to change. We need to view these as unstable. 

# But, development should be encouraged and revisits made:

# Wezterm @ 10/2024, for example, has much potential but an idiosyncratic command line,  
# requests manual closure and has over 900 open issues with which to contend ...

# At the other extreme, and with the advent of Wayland, other projects have been abandoned completely. 
# Termite, for example, now encourages the use of Alacritty ...
