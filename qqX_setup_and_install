#  THIS SCRIPT SHOULD BE RUN FROM INSIDE THE qqX DOWNLOAD/SOURCE FOLDER, where it will expect to find the right files 
#  OR  run the target script "./qqX_system_install"  from qqX.system folder directly

#  From version 1.10.03  a posix friendly .sh script is used as a wrapper, to make sure that it double click executes properly
#  in Qt / KDE XFCE etc desktop environments.  

#   IF: your file manager allows > double mouse click & 'run in terminal' or 'execute'

#   OR:  in the script's folder > right click > 'run as program' or 'run in konsole' or 'run in terminal'

#   OR:  in the script's folder > right click > open in terminal >  type "./qqX_setup_and_install"   (note prefix ./)

#   FOR ANY NEWER OR NON-STANDARD TERMINAL, SETTING UP A CUSTOM TERMINAL PROFILE IS RECOMMENDED
#   as this will cause the values to be stored for future updates.

#   CUSTOM terminal sizes & profile should be set just after the initial system checking lines
#   in the target script "./qqX_system_install" in the qqX.system folder. See notes in the target script.

#   shellcheck disable=SC2009,SC2034

#   Terminal name may also be set here, for one-time usage, if '-e' exec functions are recognised:
