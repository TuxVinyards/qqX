The folder 'qqX.custom' is designed to be installable at the default location, 
or other, and to be qqX upgrade resistant. 

Manual creation of the folder is required. 

The qqX installer/upgrader will/should ignore all direct references to it. 

Chmod a +rx will be given recursively to the whole of the /usr/share/qqX folder, 
or other. Anything placed there will become executable ....
