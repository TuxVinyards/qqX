## 'QUICKEMU' & 'QUICKGET'  VERSIONING:

# IMPORTANT @ 2024/04  quickemu has been undergoing major changes. Using system defaults is no longer recommended.

# TO KEEP qqX STABLE, built-in releases are being introduced from qqX version 1.8 onwards.
# These are identical to the official releases, except for changes to the version number, for identification purposes.
# The idea is to remain independent and to make sure that sudden changes to quickemu don't have any unexpected results.

# In order for qqX to output extra log files and to make early fixes to known quickemu errors
# a consistent source file pattern is required.

# Different names are as follows: 
# System     - use with caution, new releases may cause problems
# HomeBird   - last known stable version  (default for release 1.8.01 and = 4.9.2)
# FreeBird   - the current release version (expected to be availble shortly as Version 5?, and to become new default)
# FreeSpirit - the official current version but with cherry-picked pre-release proposals (expected following on from V5 release)


# In the past, different quickget/quickemu release/custom versions have been generally mix/matchable.  However, a structure
# similar to quickemu 4.4 onwards has been needed.  

# For VM compatibility reasons, different quickemu/quickget versions maybe be needed.  
# Suggested name format 'quickemu-48' 'quickget-44' 'QE-46' etc  ...  QE = quickemu   QG = quickget
# D/L at:  https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/releases   May also be used for development beta testing.

# Note that official releases of quickget tend to refer to quickemu for the version number.
# Give full path/filename  eg  QE_Version="/media/xxx/Files/VMQs/QE_ScriptFolder/quickemu-42" 

  QE_Version="HomeBird"                
  QG_Version="HomeBird"


## qqX UPDATES:

# Checks quietly for new GitHub releases (set =1 if not required)
  Disable_qqX_upd_Checks=

# Un Hide beta releases  (when checking is enabled)  Default =1  hide
  Hide_qqX_BetaUpdates=1

# Option for a Specified folder, in which sub folder "qqX.releases" gets to be placed, other than the usual like ~/Downloads
# Give full path eg "/media/xxx/Storage/qqX.files"  
  Specified_Updates_Location=


## OTHER PROGRAMS:

# TEXT EDITOR  
# Leave blank to use system defaults for editing the settings file, otherwise give "name" of a specific editor 
# eg. gedit, pluma, gnome-text-editor, kate ...  If not found qqX will try defaults ...
# typing 'xdg-mime query default text/plain' at the terminal may help
  TextEditor=

# FILE MANAGER
# Allows opening of the VM folder into new window, to view log files and contents (distro behaviour may vary)
# XDG default followed by popular names selected in the following order: caja, nautilus, dolphin, pcmanfm
# Terminal command  'xdg-mime query default inode/directory' may help.
# May be left blank, if not known.  Or may be set ="no" to hide menu options, if name cannot be resolved.
  FileManager=

# WEB BROWSER
# Allows opening of VM homepages and other URL's  (distro behaviour may vary).
# Terminal command 'xdg-settings get default-web-browser' may help.
# Known issue  https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/firefox-snap-testing-2021-2022/24663/93
# XDG default followed popular names selected in the following order: firefox, google-chrome, falkon
# Give quoted name or may be left blank, if not known.  Or may be set ="no" to hide menu options, if name cannot be resolved.
  WebBrowser=


##  BOOT DEFAULTS:

# SCREEN PERCENTAGE may be added here.  Use just the value, eg. ="68"   Suggested values from 50 to 70
# From quickemu 4.8 onwards, where value is integer from 25 to 99  & for Linux VM's, SDL only.
  Default_SDL_ScreenPercent="60"

# INDIVIDUAL SCREEN PERCENTAGE may also be placed in the .conf file with 'Custom_SDL_ScreenPercent' as ="xx"  

# GL GRAPHICS by default are "on".  Individually, placing gl as = "off" in the .conf file will reverse this.
# This state may be toggled from the main menu or set here to normally boot as "off"

# While "on" can give enhanced output, "off" has increased distro compatibility and also allows scaling in SDL mode
# Leave blank for "on" or set =1 for "off"  Individually, both states of "on" or "off" may be set in the .conf file.
  SetGL_DefaultAsOff=  
#

# LOCALE 
# Setting to =1  will increase the use of more locale-centric language/typeface features, if needed
# BUT this may upset some input/output filters ....  (CAUTION)
  AllowMoreLocale=

# MSR
# Set =1 for more prompting.  Standard prompting will be less active in warning situations.  
# Setting MSR_Warnings to =1 will unhide minor warnings on the standard (non technical) interface
  MSR_Warnings=
  Verbose_MSR_dialog=
# File location for default KVM behaviour for unhandled machine-specific registers. 
# Leave blank for standard settings. Edit here if your OS locates 'modprobe.d' differently. 
# quickemu / qwrap / qqX  default is "/etc/modprobe.d/kvm-quickemu.conf"
  KVM_MSR_ModProbeFile=

# KILL DIALOG  
# Time adjuster for pkill display. Adds a delay to allow background processes time to output to screen.
# Normal recommended integer = 2 to 10 secs   Adjust if your guest/host combo's find this too fast or slow.
# Originally intended, primarily, to handle the "gl_version 46" output.  This particular is now filtered from QEMU 8.0 on ... 
  P_Kill_WaitSecs="6"


##  SHARED or SECOND DRIVES:  

# May be auto-created in qqX via the utils menu.
# The Shared drive is a useful when in SDL mode & available to all VMs while a Second drive is a quick way to expand 
# an individual VM's storage. Use Gparted, 'Disks' or similar, inside a VM, to set a file table, format and mount. 

# Give SharedDrive *full* location here  eg. ="$Default_VM_Folder/SharedDrive/shared.qcow2"   
# SET SharedDrive_Conf as ="no-shared" IN THE .CONF FILE to individually stop the Shared Drive from loading
  SharedDrive=""

# For WINDOWS, the drive should be set as GPT & formatted as NTFS. The process should carried out by a Linux OS.

# MAC OS older than and including 10.13 Mojave 2018 *might* need a flag IN THE .CONF FILE to stop possible drive conflicts.
# Quickemu code has the following note: "VirtIO Block Media doesn't work in High Sierra (at all) or the Mojave (Recovery Image)"
# Development tests with Mojave show both a Shared NTFS and a Second APFS to be working.
# SET MacLegacyDrive as ="true" to load Second Drive (& not Shared) as 'ide-hd' instead of 'virtio-blk-pci'
# SharedDrive always loads as 'virtio-blk-pci'   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history

# qqX adds SecondDrives to the .CONF FILE, eg as ="Windows-11/storage.qcow2" 


## ERRORS:

# QEMU ERROR FILTER  -  QL LOG
# Add here any 'errors' that changes in QEMU might throw up and that we want to generally ignore  eg. "warning" or "deprecated"
# Add QemuError_VM_Filter=("warning" "deprecated") eg. to the .conf file for INDIVIDUALLY problematic distros.
# @ 2023/12 Defaults:  # QemuErrorFilter=("gl_version" "signal 15 from pid")
# Add any new values to the checking arrays as double quoted & space separated. Use the '+=' for further lines.
  QemuErrorFilter=("gl_version" "signal 15 from pid")
# QemuErrorFilter+=("") 


# FIXES for QUICKEMU'S  QEMU  'args'
# Selected fixes & hot-fixes for the quickemu code that gets passed to QEMU, 
# where quickemu has not yet fixed things or has released the fix.  Some may not be needed or may be distro specfic.
# Set = blank to disable, if causing problems or if not needed with your particular installation.  Set = 1 to activate.
  FixArgs_hpet=1
  FixArgs_smartcard=1


## QEMU VERSION

# Overide to handle future quickemu errors from changes to Qemu numbering format
# Note QEMU 6.0.0 or newer is required   Set overide =1  if version is known to be newer.
  QemuShortVerOveride=

# Hardcoded quickemu default is 'qemu-system-x86_64' with machine 'q35'
# For unexpected QEMU changes, system may be set here, if required.
# At the cmd line, type: "qemu-system-x86_64 -machine help"  to see machine options  
  QEMU_Default_SystemType=
  QEMU_Default_MachineType=  


##  qqX CUSTOM BOOTING, including the Arm, Risc-V and other machine & system types

# The file "Qemu_ShortArgs_List.txt" in the VM folder may be used as the basis for INDIVIDUAL custom boot scripts
# Run the VM in the boot mode required, eg sdl, spice etc.  Verbose output may be used, esp. if the VM is not expected to boot.
# Then from the VM folder the ShortArgs file may be renamed as "Qemu_ShortArgs_Custom.txt" and edited line by line.
# Comments and blank lines may be used, and will be ignored.
# See qqX wiki for further how to details and discussion

# Extra * QEMU * args may be added here, as GLOBAL. Also add ad hoc via the main menu.
# Format = "group quoted" with single-space separated elements eg:  ExtraArgs="-device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0" 
# See  https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/invocation.html
  ExtraArgs=

# Extra * QUICKEMU * parameters to be used GLOBALLY at VM run time  
# Format = "group quoted" with single-space separated elements eg:  Extra_QE_Params="--screen 0" 
# See quickemu --help for full list   NB  not all options can be applicable  CAUTION 
# Of note:  "--full-screen" only works with spice display ...  &&  will overide --screenpct
# DUAL DISPLAY  users should set "--screen 0" or "--screen 1" to select the monitor
# See quickemu project main page for more details: https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu
  Extra_QE_Params=

# HEADLESS commands may be set using Extra_QE_Params using "--display none"  BUT
# to avoid this affecting all machines it is recommended to add 'HeadlessDisplay' as ="true" to the .conf file 
# NB headless ONLY RUNS IN SPICE and an SSH connection may need to be set as an extra QE parameter
# Originally: https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu#headless   --ssh-port <port> : Set ssh-port manually
# BUT Improved from Quickemu 4.9.1  https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/pull/835
# --access : Enable remote spice access support. 'local' | 'remote' | 'clientipaddress'     
# May be set INDIVIDUALLY by placing eg ACCESS="1.1.1.1" in the .conf file  (NB 'ACCESS' in CAPS, but value in lower case)
# Note that if unset then quickemu will default this to = local

# VERBOSE BOOT
# Set =1  to normally display the qemu args, with okay dialogue, in human readable & before booting.  
# Set blank for log file only. NB An main menu toggle is also available and a log file is always outputted to the VM's folder
  VerboseArgs= 


## TIANO Boot updates

# The Tiano boot system that is used by quickemu will require updating if there are feature or security changes made to the code.
# (03/2024) Quickemu, currently places edk.fd vars into the VM folder. And there they remain.
# It is theoretically possible that system updates containing feature changes may seek variables in these files that don't exist.
# Quickemu will also place binary files, in the case of MacOS, which are only downloaded by running Quickget. 
# There are also .bin files listed in the Quickemu code for use by some Linux distros .... 

# qqX features an [rtv] option which may be run manually, to Refresh (the) Tiano Variables (and such).
# But to avoid tedium, this feature defaults to periodically auto-running. Set = 1 to turn this off, if required (?)
  RtvManualOnly=

# In manual-only mode, qqX will remind you, from time to time, to run the updater. 
# The MacOS reminder runs more frequently, as this is viewed as more critical.
# As above, set = 1 to turn these off too, if required (?)  
  RtvStdRmdOff=
  RtvMacosRmdOff=

# Standard Arm AAVMF source folder = "/usr/share/AAVMF"  >>  Variations may be placed here.  
# Defaults to auto-update, as below.
  RtvArmFolder=


# CUSTOM SETTINGS FILE
# The qqX upgrader utility will tidy up and possibly remove any 'obsolete' code and comments from this file ...
# For advanced custom tweaks or things that you want to keep safe, you should make a custom settings file,
# next door to this one, in '.qqX' in your home folder (normally use ctrl-h to unhide) "$HOME/.qqX/custom_settings"
